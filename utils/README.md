# utils

This directory is for random utility files that I've found useful
during development and testing of the photobooth. They are not
necessary for the actual running of the system, but you may find them
handy.

* [usbreset](usbreset): Reset all USB devices

* [jbp.sh](jbp.sh): Add Jessie Backports to repositories and install gphoto2.

* [fpscomparison.py](fpscomparison.py): Find out which gphoto2 backend has fastest previews.

* [capturetime.py](capturetime.py): Find out which gphoto2 backend
  takes photos the quickest. (Spoiler: None are as fast as opencv).
