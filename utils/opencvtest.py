# This program just prints out camera FPS every second.

# My Logitech QuickCam gets slower on every read() when I use OpenCV
# 2.4.9 but works fine with other V4L2 apps. If I release and reopen
# the camera, it becomes fast again.

# ADDENDUM. After rebooting with a different USB power cable, suddenly
# my camera stays at a constant 14 FPS. This is bizarre, but then
# again, low current problems can be weird.


# This is what the output looks like on my Raspberry Pi 3B and
# Logitech QuickCam:
